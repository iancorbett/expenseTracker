# Expense Tracker (Raw PHP + PDO + MySQL)

This is a simple **raw PHP** demo project built without frameworks.  
It connects to a MySQL database with PDO, imports records from a CSV file,  
and displays them in an HTML table.

This project was created to demonstrate **custom PHP development** skills  
outside of Laravel or other frameworks.
